turbojpeg_ios
=============

turbo jpeg for ios with both 32bit and 64 bit suport.

I do not change source files so much from original turbo jpeg. Most changes are with project settings. However I found it is so tricky to build it successfully.

The initial version of such is from someone on github, but unfortunately I cannot remember. I will search it and append the info. when possible.

-How to use the code.
 Build the project and include the generated .a files (3 files) and .h files in your project.
 The source files may not be included in your project for xcode compilation.
